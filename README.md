A simplified Course Registration System.
The system should allow students to register for courses, check enrollment status, manage course capacities, and manage 
waitlists, as well as some additional functions in regards to adding/deleting/editiing students and courses.

Data structures such as queues, stacks, and linked lists were used.

Linked List: Use linked lists to store information about students and courses, allowing for dynamic 
resizing and efficient insertions/deletions. 
Stacks: Implement a stack to manage the history of student course registrations, allowing students 
to undo their last registration if needed. 
Queues: Use a queue to manage a waitlist for courses that have reached capacity.
